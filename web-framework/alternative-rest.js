// GraphQL: Best for flexible and complex data queries. Widely adopted in modern apps.
// gRPC: Best for microservices, internal communication, and low-latency apps.
// WebSockets: Best for real-time communication and event-driven applications.
// JSON-RPC / XML-RPC: Best for lightweight method invocation, but less commonly used than REST and GraphQL.



// ! When to Use Each in a Single Backend?
// REST API:

// ? External communication.
// Simple, stateless APIs for CRUD operations.
// Public APIs for general usage.
// gRPC:

// ? Internal microservices communication.
// High-performance, low-latency communication.
// Efficient and compact communication for services.
// Bi-directional streaming for real-time data transfer.
// WebSockets:

// ? Real-time bidirectional communication between the client and the server.
// Event-driven communication (e.g., notifications, chat apps, live updates).
// Persistent connections for interactive applications.
